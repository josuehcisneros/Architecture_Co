00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:15.787
Long live the walls we pass through
How the lights of the kingdom shine just for me

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:22.948
and you were shouting: "Long live all the magic we did" And bring all the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:33.013
suitors I'm not afraid.  Long live all the mountains we moved. I had the time to

00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:40.009
my life fighting dragons with you
He was shouting, "Long live that look on your face."

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:47.693
And bring all the suitors
One day we will be remembered
